- üì¶ Full TypeScript support with shared types
- üß™ Comprehensive testing: unit, integration, and visual tests
- üéØ API routes with Hono's elegant routing
- üîÑ Dual-context build system (frontend + backend)
- ‚ö° Zero-config deployment to Cloudflare's global network
- üîé Built-in observability to monitor your Worker
- üåì Dark mode support out of the box
- ‚ôø Accessible components from shadcn/ui + Radix UI

## üìê Architecture

This project uses a **dual-context build system** with three separate TypeScript contexts:

1. **React App** (`src/react-app/`) - Client-side React application
2. **Worker** (`src/worker/`) - Cloudflare Workers backend (Hono API)
3. **Shared Code** (`src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`) - Reusable UI components and utilities

The Worker serves the React app as static assets and handles API routes under `/api/*`.

**Path Aliases**: All imports use `@/*` aliases pointing to `src/`:
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

For detailed architecture documentation, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Install it globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

### Primary Workflows

Start the main development server (frontend + backend):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Start Storybook for component development:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Storybook will be available at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

### Code Quality

Type check your code:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Lint your code:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Testing

Run all tests (builds first, then runs all 3 test suites):

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run individual test suites:

```bash
pnpm test:worker     # Backend/API tests
pnpm test:ui         # React component unit tests
pnpm test:storybook  # Storybook visual/interaction tests
```

## Component Development

This project follows a systematic component-driven development workflow:

1. **Check existing components** - Review component files and Storybook stories
2. **Compose or extend** - Build from existing components or add variants
3. **Search shadcn registry** - Find pre-built components if needed
4. **Add tests and stories** - Always update Storybook and add tests

Add new shadcn/ui components:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

Components are installed to `src/components/ui/` and can be customized directly.

For detailed workflow, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#component-development).

## Production

Build your project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview your build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

Monitor your deployed worker:

```bash
npx wrangler tail
```

- **Staging**: `pnpm deploy` (defaults to staging environment)
- **Production**: Requires explicit configuration and verification

All Wrangler commands should be scoped to an environment (typically `staging`).
